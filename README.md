# Type-effect-Java-Script
<h1>The professional Type effect with advanced customization .</h1>

<h3> You have incredible options for this script but you can just set two of the <code>data-</code> variables and work correctly.

<h4><a href="https://araship1383.github.io/Type-effect-Java-Script/"> See this demo</a></h4>



<p>And you can customize it with this instruction:

    
Set the <code>data-w-s</code> for how many times(in <code>milliesecond</code>) wait for the first letter.

    
Set the <code>data-w-t</code> for how many times(in <code>milliesecond</code>) wait for erase the complete word.


Set the <code>data-w-e</code> for how many times(in <code>milliesecond</code>) wait for type the next word after completly erase the previouse word.


<h3>You must set one of the <code>data-w-t</code> or <code>data-w-e</code> or <code>data-w-s</code>.</h3>


Set the <code>data-s-t</code> for the speed of the type for each word (in <code>milliesecond</code>).

       
Set the <code>data-s-e</code> for the speed of the erase for each word (in <code>milliesecond</code>).


<h3>You must set one of the <code>data-s-t</code> or <code>data-s-e</code>.</h3>


Set the <code>data-words</code> for set words. (It just need to set it like that : <code>data-words = '"anything","anything","anything","anything"'</code> ). <h3>&#128070; (This is very essential).</h3>

<h2>How to use this code in HTML?? &#129300;</h2>

You can use <code>variables</code> class to any where you want in your HTML code.

Use class <code>type</code> for the result of the type effect (It can be a <code>block</code> elements or <code>inline-block</code> elements).

And use class <code>typecrow</code> for the animation of the type blinking. <h3> &#128070; (It must be not the children of <code>type</code> element).</h3>

<h3>Here is the example of the HTML code :

<pre><code>&lt;p class = "type variables" data-w-s = "1000" data-s-t = "100" data-words = '"to you!!","github!","world!"'&gt;Hello &lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class="typecrow"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre></h3>
